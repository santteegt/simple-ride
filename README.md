# simple-ride

Webapp for the Simple Ride platform based on Ionic 3.x.x and Meteor framework >1.4 as backend

## Prerequisites

* NPM ([How-to](https://nodejs.org/en/))
* Meteor ([How-to](https://www.meteor.com/install))
* Meteor Client Bundler -> Install it running the command `npm install -g meteor-client-bundler`
* Ionic ([How-to](https://ionicframework.com/getting-started/))
* Android SDK with tools 25.1.6 and platform-tools 25.0.1

## Deploy/Build app for production

* Execute the following command

```
$ cd api && meteor npm install
$ npm run api # Configure api script parameters accordingly in the packages.json file
```

### Mobile app setup

* After cloning the repo, run the following command:

```
npm install
```

* In order to run the app on a mobile device or build the app in production mode, you **MUST** temporarily remove the following packages in the Meteor backend. **REMEMBER** to discard those changes before deploying the backend

```
cd api
meteor remove angular2-compilers barbatus:angular2-polyfills
meteor add ecmascript
cd ..
npm run meteor-client:bundle # Configure meteor-client.config.json accordingly
ionic cordova run [android|ios] # run on a connected device
ionic cordova run [android|ios] --prod --release # run on a connected device for production testing
```

* `uint8` and `uint32` gives problems on some browsers. To avoid this, comment these lines on `node_modules/meteor-client.js`

```
_require('core-js/modules/es6.typed.uint8-array'); // 56
_require('core-js/modules/es6.typed.uint32-array'); // 57
```

#### Android setup

* Generate keystore file
```
$HOME/platforms/android $ keytool -genkey -v -keystore simpleride.keystore -alias SimpleRide -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000
```

* When running the app on an android device, Gradle might give you problems, so add the following to the end of `platforms/android/build.gradle` file:

```
configurations.all {
    resolutionStrategy.eachDependency { DependencyResolveDetails details ->
        def requested = details.requested
        if (requested.group == 'com.android.support') {
            if (!requested.name.startsWith("multidex")) {
                details.useVersion '25.3.1'
            }
        }
    }
}
```

#### iOS setup

* After building the app, open the project on XCode. Do not forget to check the following parameters on the info.plist properties file:

NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription: string description

NSCameraUsageDescription: string description

NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription: string description of the need of accessing the user photo library

NSMotionUsageDescription: string description of the need of accesing the user geolocation while he is in motion

* When building the app, a missing `SimpleRide.pod` file should appear as an error. You must delete it under `Build Phases/Embed Pods Frameworks`

### Run the mobile app locally

To run the app locally, you need an NGINX instance with the following configuration:

```
server {
    listen      80;
    server_name <API-SERVER-IP-ADDRESS>;

    location / {
      proxy_pass http://<MOBILEAPP-CLIENT-IP-ADDRESS>:8100;
    }
    location ~ ^/(_oauth|packages|ufs) {
      proxy_pass http://<API-SERVER-IP-ADDRESS>:3000;
    }
    location /sockjs {
      proxy_pass http://<API-SERVER-IP-ADDRESS>:3000;
      proxy_http_version 1.1;
      proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
      proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
    }

    error_page  500 502 503 504 /50x.html;
    location = /50x.html {
    root /usr/share/nginx/html;
    }
}
```

For a complete config file example, take a look to the [nginx.conf.example](nginx.conf.example) file.

To restart nginx service you can use the following commands:

```
$ kill -QUIT $( cat /run/nginx.pid )
$ /usr/sbin/nginx -t -c /etc/nginx/nginx.conf # IF YOU WANT TO TEST THE CONFIG FILE FIRST
$ /usr/sbin/nginx -c /etc/nginx/nginx.conf # START THE SERVICE. In UBUNTU, you can use systemctl [stop|start] nginx.service
```

Finally, to start serving the mobile app in your local machine, run the following command:

```
ionic serve # run on the desktop

```

### Develop/Teset admin pages locally

In order to develop/test admin features make sure to specity port 3000 in the ROOT_URL environment variable on the `api` script defined in the packages.json file. For example: `ROOT_URL=http://<local_IP_address>:<3000>`. This is very important to configure if you don't have to experiment any issues with facebook login

### Deploying the Server under a AWS EC2 instance using mup

* Configure `api/.deploy/mup.js` accordingly

* Run the following commands:

```
cd api/.deploy
mup setup
mup deploy
```

More info about conf: [click here](https://github.com/kadirahq/meteor-up)

* To inspect the server logs, you can execute the following command:

```
cd api/.deploy
mup logs -f
```
### Backend Setup

* Configure Server IP address in the `api/package.json` script accordingly

## MongoDB Backup

* To **manually** backup the mongodb schema see this [instructions](https://github.com/xpressabhi/mup-data-backup)


## Push Notifications Setup

1. Enable the following code under the `server/main.js` file

```
import "./imports/push.js"; // ENABLE PUSH NOTIFICATIONS
```

### iOS

2. If you already have valid certificates, jump through to step 8
3. Generate Push Notification Certificates for development and production through the Apple Developer site. (aps_development.cer & aps.cer)
4. Import them into the KeyChain Access
5. Export them into .p12 certificates (name them as CertificateDev.p12 & CertificateProd.p12 respectively)
6. Run the following commands:

```
$ openssl x509 -in aps_development.cer -inform DER -outform PEM -out SimpleRide-dev.pem
$ openssl pkcs12 -in CertificateDev.p12 -out SimpleRideKey-dev.pem -nodes
$ openssl x509 -in aps.cer -inform DER -outform PEM -out SimpleRide-prod.pem
$ openssl pkcs12 -in CertificateProd.p12 -out SimpleRideKey-prod.pem -nodes
```

7. Optionally, you can test the certificates by running the following:

```
# Development
$ openssl s_client -connect gateway.sandbox.push.apple.com:2195 -cert meteorApp-cert-dev.pem -key meteorApp-key-dev.pem
# Production
$ openssl s_client -connect gateway.push.apple.com:2195 -cert meteorApp-cert-prod.pem -key meteorApp-key-prod.pem
```

8. Paste the generated files on the `private/push_certs` folder
9. If you are testing push notifications under development, enable the following lines on the `server/main.js` file:

```
// For testing push notifications under development
declare var process;
process.env.NODE_ENV = "development";
```

10. Configure the `server/imports/push.js` file accordingly

11. Remember to enable Push Notifications on XCode before Archiving the app to be uploaded to the App Store, or for local development

### Android

2. You need to obtain a Server API Key and a SENDERID from the Firebase Cloud Messaging console

3. Update the SENDERID value on the `src/app/pages/login/login.component.mobile.ts` component

4. Update the FCM API key on the file `server/imports/push.js`

6. If you are testing push notifications under development, enable the following lines on the `server/main.js` file:

```
// For testing push notifications under development
declare var process;
process.env.NODE_ENV = "development";
```

7. In production, remember to link your FCM APi Key with the app in Google Play. Take a look at this [README](https://github.com/raix/push/blob/master/docs/ANDROID.md#linking-the-fcm-service-to-your-android-app) for instructions
